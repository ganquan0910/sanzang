= \Sanzang (三藏)

== Introduction

\Sanzang is a compact and simple cross-platform machine translation system.
This program is especially useful for translating from CJK languages (Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean), and it is very suitable for ancient and otherwise
difficult texts. Due to its origins in translating texts from the Chinese
Buddhist canon, the program is called \Sanzang (三藏), a literal translation of
the Sanskrit word "Tripitaka," which is a general term for the Buddhist canon.
As demonstrated by the _sanzang_ program itself:

    $ echo 三藏 | sanzang t sztab
    [1.1] 三藏
    [1.2]  sānzàng
    [1.3]  tripiṭaka

Anyone can learn how to use \Sanzang, and use it to read and analyze texts.
Unlike most other systems, \Sanzang is small and approachable. Users can
develop their own translation rules, and these rules are simply stored in a
text file and applied at runtime.

\Sanzang is free software ("free as in freedom"), and it is released under the
GNU General Public License, version 3.
